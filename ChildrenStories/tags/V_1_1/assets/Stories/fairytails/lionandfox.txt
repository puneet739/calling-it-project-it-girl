Once upon a time there lived an old lion in the forest. He could no longer go for hunting. One day he saw a cave. He went inside the cave and found that it was empty. He was sure that it belonged to some animal. He thought that he could be inside the cave and wait for the animal and thus kill it.
The cave belonged to a fox. The fox returned to the cave in the evening. He became suspicious when he saw the foot prints of the lion outside his cave. He thought of a plan to make sure that there was nobody inside the cave.
He spoke aloud “Dear cave, how are you?” No answer came. He again said “Dear cave why are you not talking to me? You know that you are my best friend and we chat for long hours everyday”. The lion was listening to the jackal.He thought that probably the cave really talks to the fox. The fox again said”Dear cave if you do not speak to me , I will go away.” Hearing this the lion became unhappy. So, he thought of speaking instead of the cave. He said “No my dear friend, please come inside and we can chat”.
Hearing the lion’s voice he became alert and went away. He ran away never to return to the cave.

Moral: Presence of mind is very important.
