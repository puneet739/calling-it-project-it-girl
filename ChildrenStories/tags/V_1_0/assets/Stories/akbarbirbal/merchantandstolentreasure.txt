One day two merchants named Ramu and Shamu came to Akbar’s court.
Ramu spoke first. He said “Your Majesty! This is my friend Shamu. I had given him my treasure before going on business work to another town. After returning from there  when I ask him to return that, he says that I never gave him anything.”
            Shamu said “No Your Majesty! You can check my house, Ramu never gave me any treasure. He is lying.”
            Akbar told his soldiers to check Shamu’s house in the evening. The soldiers did not find anything.
Ramu ang Shamu were again in the court the next day. Akbar said “we could not find anything in Shamu’s house. So, Ramu must be lying.” Ramu said “No sir, I am not lying.”
Birbal was listening and said “ Your Majesty! Give me a chance to solve this case. Actually I have found the treasure and I have kept in my house. I will submit it in the court tomorrow.” Everyone was surprised. The court was adjourned. Ramu and Shamu left to their respective houses.
   Birbal asked the soldiers to follow Shamu in disguise. Shamu went home and after sometime he came out. He went into a forest and dug a place near a big Banyan tree. He took out a big bag in which there were ornaments. Immediately the soldiers arrested him.
            They produced him in the court before the king. Birbal said     “Your Majesty! Yesterday I lied to you. I did not find any treasure. I wanted to find out whether Shamu was innocent. But, when I said so, Shamu became anxious and went and checked the place for treasure where he had really hidden the treasure. So please arrest Shamu and handover this treasure to Ramu.”
Akbar was very happy with Birbal.
