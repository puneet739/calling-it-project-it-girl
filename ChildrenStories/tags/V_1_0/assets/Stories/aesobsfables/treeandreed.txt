There was a huge tree with large branches and well penetrated into the ground. One day the tree saw a small reed growing at its feet. The tree said to the reed, “Look at me. I am so huge and strong. My roots are deep inside the ground. But you are so small. You can easily be pulled out. The reed only said, “Sir, I am satisfied with what I have and I think I am safer.” The tree laughed it away.

Soon after sometime, there was a hurricane. The tree could not withstand and all its leaves fell. Its braches were broken and soon it remained as a lifeless log. The reed whereas bent to the force of the wind and remained safe. It stood upright after the storm passed.
