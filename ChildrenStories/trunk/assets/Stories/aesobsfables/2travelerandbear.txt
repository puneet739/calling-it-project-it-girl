One day two travelers were passing through a jungle. Suddenly they saw a bear. One of the travelers who were in front seized a branch of tree and hid among the leaves. The other fellow did not know what to do. He lay down acting as if he were dead. The bear came near the person and sniffed and  tried to check his breath. The man held his breath tightly. Contended that the man was dead, the bear left the place. The other traveler joined him and asked jokingly, what the bear had whispered in his ear. The traveler said, “the bear asked me not to befriend a person who leaves you in times of danger.”
