Once upon a time there lived a Brahmin. He was very innocent and used to believe in whatever others said.
Once his wife asked him to get a cow from the market so that they can have milk everyday. He went to the market and bought a cow. On the way to his house, he had to pass through a jungle. Three thieves saw him coming with the cow. They planned a way to steal the cow even without the knowledge of the Brahmin.
     The first thief went to the Brahmin and said “ Dear sir, why are you taking a donkey with you? The Brahmin was surprised. He said, “ Who are you? And can’t you see I am taking a cow with me? Don’t come my way.” The thief said, “I am sorry sir .I only said what I saw” And the thief left.
The second thief came and said to the Brahmin, “ Hello friend, the goat you are taking with you looks very healthy. But you look to be a vegetarian. Why are you taking this with you?”. The Brahmin said,      “What rubbish are you talking? I am taking a cow with me and you saying I am taking a goat with me?” The thief said “ I beg your pardon.I only said what I observed”. He gave a surprised look at the animal and left.
The third thief came and said to the Brahmin, “ Wow, this sheep has so much of fur. Are you taking this sheep to sell this wool and make money?” The Brahmin was puzzled. He said, “ What nonsense? I am taking a cow with me.” The thief said” well this a sheep. Where is the cow? Anyway….” He gave a confused look at the cow and left.
   Now the Brahmin got upset. He thought that there is something wrong. Probably the cow he bought is not a normal one. His cow might be some ghost. Hence everyone is seeing it as different animal. He got scared. He left the cow in the jungle and ran towards is house.
The thieves happily took home the cow with them.
