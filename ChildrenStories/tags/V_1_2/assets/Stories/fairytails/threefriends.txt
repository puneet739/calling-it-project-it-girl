Once upon time there lived three friends in a jungle. They were a deer, a tortoise and a mouse. They used to meet everyday and enjoy each other’s company. They also would help each other very much. 
    One day, the three friends were playing after having lunch. A hunter came to the jungle and saw the three of them. He was very happy to see the deer. He tried to catch the deer, but the deer and the mouse ran away. The tortoise being very slow at crawling, could not escape. The hunter immediately put his net on the tortoise. As its legs got struck in the net, it was unable for it to crawl anymore. The deer and the mouse were very sad to see the tortoise in trouble. They had to pull him out.
    They acted quickly. The deer went and stood at a distance from the hunter. The hunter thought, “I have already laid my net on the tortoise. It cannot escape. Now, I can chase the deer and take two of them home.” He ran towards the deer. The deer ran slowly so that the hunter could chase him. 
     The mouse in the meantime nibbled the net in which the tortoise was trapped. The tortoise crawled and escaped into the river nearby. Seeing this the deer ran very fast and the hunter could not see it anymore. He became tired and came back to the place where he left the tortoise. He was shocked to see that his net has been nibbled and the tortoise was not seen anywhere. He went away disappointed.
    The three friends became even more  close after this.
