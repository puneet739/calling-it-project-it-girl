Tenali Rama was suddenly awakened one night by some noises. He saw that two thieves have entered his house. They were still at the gate. Tenali Rama acted quickly. He woke up his wife and said that thieves have come for theft. He asked her to just say yes to whatever he says. His wife agreed.
As Rama realized that the thieves were near their window, he said to his wife, “I am now relieved about our huge treasures that our emperor has bestowed on us. They are safe in a trunk and we have placed it in the well. No person in this word can guess where we have hidden our possessions. Now we can sleep peacefully.” His wife said, “Yes, you have come up with a brilliant idea of hiding our treasures in our well.”
Listening to this the thieves went near the well. They saw that it was not very deep. They thought they can pour all the water out by morning and take away all the treasure.
They started pouring out water from the well into a small canal besides it which led to the garden. The night passed away. They did not find any treasure. But by morning Tenali Rama’s neighbors caught the thieves. They were arrested.
Tenali Rama’s wife felt proud of her husband. She said, “Your mind really works fast and I should really thank the thieves for watering the garden. I need not do it for another week.” They smiled to each other.
