Once the farmers of Vijayanagar came to Krishnadeva Raya and said, “Sir, there are many mice in our farms and they are destroying the grain. Please show us a way to get rid of the mice.”

Krishnadeva Raya discussed with his courtiers and came to a decision. He ordered many cats from Persia. He also bought many cows. He declared, “Every house in Vijayanagaram will have to grow a cat. A cow will be given to every house so that the cat is properly fed with its milk. All the cats will be checked for their health at the end of the month.”

Everyone fed the cat well except Tenali Rama. At the end of the month the king was told that all the cat were hail and healthy except Tenali Rama’s. The king grew angry and went to see Tenali Rama.

Tenali Rama seeing the king said, “Sir, it is my duty to feed the cat, but how can I force it to drink milk?’ The King was surprised. “Bring the cat and offer some milk let me see how it does not drink milk”, said the king.

Milk was brought in a bowl and placed near the cat. It ran away. Everyone was surprised. The king said to Tenali Rama, “I know what you have done. You have fed the cat with hot milk, hence its mouth is badly burnt. Due to the fear of burning it again, it is not taking its food.”

Tenali Rama spoke, “Your Majesty, I think it is better if people have the milk rather than feeding the cat, as only healthy people can build a strong nation. Moreover how will a well fed fat cat catch mice?”

Krishnadeva Raya realized his mistake. He praised Tenali Rama.
