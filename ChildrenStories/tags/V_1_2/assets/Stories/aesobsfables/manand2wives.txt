There lived a man who had two wives. His first wife was younger to him by only an year. His second wife was much younger to him. When the man started growing old, his hair started to turn grey. The younger wife felt that this would make him look like her father to a stranger. Hence every night she would pick grey hair from his head. This upset the older wife as people might mistake her to be her husbandâ€™s mother. So, in the morning she would pick as many as black hair from his head. Soon the man was left bald.

Moral: Yield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield.
