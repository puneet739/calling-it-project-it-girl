Once a young man was caught in a daring act of theft and was condemned for public execution. He wanted to speak to his mother before that. His wish was granted. As soon as he saw his mother, he said that he wanted to whisper her something. As the mother brought her ear closer, he bit her ear badly. His mother was shocked and slapped him suddenly. The thief said, “if you had done this in my childhood when I first stole food from neighbor’s house, I would not have been here today. But, you just laughed away and appreciated for bringing without their knowledge. You encouraged me to rob little things which later became a habit.”
