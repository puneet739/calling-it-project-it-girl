Once upon a time there lived a fox in a forest. One day the fox was on its hunt for food. It came across a crow with a bit of cheese in its beak. The fox decided to have the cheese by any means. The fox said to the crow, “ Mr. Crow, you are so beautiful. You are the “King of birds”. I have heard a lot about your sweet tone. Everyone is talking about your wonderful talent of singing. Please sing a song for me too.”

The crow was very much flattered. It opened its mouth to sing and the cheese bit fell down. The fox took away the cheese and laughed at the crow.
