Once upon a time there lived a snake. It used to eat the small creatures in the jungle. It soon became very fat. It could not fit in its hole. So, he thought of searching for another hole.
    The snake came across a big anthill. It called the ants and said “ I am the snake and I am very powerful. Vacate your anthill and leave this place. I want to reside here. The ants said “But, we have put so much of hard work in making our home. How can we leave it?” But the snake insisted that they should leave.
      The ants came up with a plan. They climbed on the body of the snake. Soon, all the ants were crawling all over the body of the snake. All the ants started pricking the snake. The snake could not bear the pain and ran for his life. The ants thus succeeded in fighting with the snake.
