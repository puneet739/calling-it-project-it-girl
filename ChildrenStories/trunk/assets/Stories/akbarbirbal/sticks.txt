Birbal came forward and took another similar stick. He broke this stick into a size smaller than the stick brought by the person. He kept both the sticks beside each other. He asked everyone including the person “ Which is the long stick?” Everyone said that the stick brought by the person is the long stick . Birbal smiled and said to the person “see I have made the stick brought by you longer.”
