All stories are in text format and import directly into the Kindle 3.

92 Stories, all hard core everyday, believable fantasies. Takes me back to the days of Penthouse Forum  :-)

Will also work on other readers if they view straight text files.

To import into your Kindle:
1 - Connect Kindle to your computer via the USB cable.
2 - Once Kindle shows up on your computer (look in Windows Explorer "My Computer"), drop files into the "documents" folder in the kindle.
3 - You can drop individual files or entire folders of books/stories.
4 - Disconnect your Kindle, turn it on, and give it a minute to refresh and the books will be present.
