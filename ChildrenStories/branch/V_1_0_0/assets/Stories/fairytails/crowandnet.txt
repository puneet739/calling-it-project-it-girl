Once upon a time there lived a group of crows in a jungle. Among them was an old and wise crow by the name Vidhura. He was very concerned about the well being of all the other crows.
    One day a fowler came to jungle. He had plans to trap the crows under his net. Thus, he strewed some grains to attract the birds. He sat at a distance from this place so that no one could see him. 
    The flock of crows were passing through that way. They were happy to see the grains. Vidhura observed that such grains were not available in the jungle. He immediately understood that there must be something tricky about them. He warned the crows about  this. But, the young crows did not pay attention to his words. The crows landed on the ground to eat the grains. Suddenly a net fell on them and they all got struck under it. They called Vidhura for help. Vidhura saw the hunter coming from a distance to collect the trapped birds. He acted fast and advised the birds to fly along with net. All the birds at once rose to sky and started flying along the direction Vidhura was taking them. 
     The hunter was very surprised to see the sight. He was shouting and wailing but in vain. Vidhura flew towards the mountain side. Near the mountain lived a rat who was a good friend of Vidhura. Vidhura told the birds to stop at the ratâ€™s hole. He called the rat out. He explained the situation to his friend and requested him to cut the net with his strong teeth. The rat at once called its fellow rats and they cut the net. 
   The crows were all set free. They all thanked the rats for their help. They thanked Vidhura also for his presence of mind.
