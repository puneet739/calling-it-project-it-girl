=============================================================
1) I was constantly facing with "Absent Code attribute in method that is not native or abstract in class file javax/transaction/SystemException"
Solution:: for the same, i added the JTA dependency in pom.xml and the issue worked.

			<groupId>javax.transaction</groupId>
			<artifactId>jta</artifactId>
			<version>1.1</version>
		</dependency>

2) Now facing the issue as "Absent Code attribute in method that is not native or abstract in class file javax/validation/Validation"
