Once upon a time there lived a young poor Brahmin in a village. He was very lazy.He used to stay alone in his hut. He used to perform rituals in the village and get home whatever food he got as alms.
   One day he brought the flour given by someone and kept it in a pot. He hung it beside his bed. He laid down on his bed and started thinking. 
     He thought he would sell this flour in the shop. He would get some money from there.
He would start a small business of selling fruits from that money. Soon his business would grow and he will become owner of a big fruits stall. Then he would get married. After that he would have a son. His son would be very naughty. One day while playing he will break a flower vase. Then, he would become very angry and beat him with a stick.
    Thinking so, he took a stick near him and started hitting in the air. The stick hit the pot and it broke. All the flour fell all over the ground. He became very sad to see this.
He learnt two things with this incident. One should plan well but should not dream always. They should put their dreams into reality by working hard. The second thing is that one should never be very angry.
