Krishnadeva Raya once consulted his head priest regarding his mother’s death anniversary. He asked the priest, “I want to do something on her anniversary due to which her soul will rest in peace.” The head priest took this as opportunity to earn money. He enquired the king what his mother’s last wish was. The king said, “My mother loved mangoes a lot, but breathed last before they were placed before her. So, desire to eat a mango can be considered as her last wish.” Then the priest said, “Your Majesty, your mother’s soul will rest in peace if you fulfill her last wish. As she is no more, you can do an alternate thing. Give away 108 golden mangoes placed in 108 silver bowls to 108 Brahmins as dhanam. This will definitely make her soul more peaceful. The king agreed.
The dhanam was given.
Tenali Rama came to know about this. He realized how greedy the priest was. He wanted to teach him a lesson.

Tenali Rama called upon the priest once and said that he wanted to give dhaanam in the name of her expired mother. The priest felt happy as it was yet another opportunity to fill his pockets. Tenali Rama also invited Krishnadeva Raya for the ceremony. Tenali Rama took a red hot poker and went to the head priest. He said, “Dear sir, my mother was suffering from pain and wanted a red hot poker to be placed on her hand. As she died before her wish was fulfilled, let me perform the act on you along with all the Brahmins whom you brought with you now.” Saying this he took the poker near the priest and placed it on his hand. He cried in pain and left the place in hurry along with his other colleagues. The king realized his mistake and thanked Tenali Rama profusely for bringing into light the true nature of the priest.
