Once upon a time there was an earthquake in a village. All the houses were ruined and all the villagers left the village. Taking this as advantage many mice occupied the village.They were living happily there.
    They had one problem. There was a big river near the village. A herd of elephants used to come to the river for having water. They had to pass through the village. Due to this many mice used to get trampled under the feet of elephants. The King Mouse thought of resolving this problem.
     King Mouse went to the elephants and said” Dear sir, when you pass through this village many of my friends get hurt. Please change your route. I promise that we will help you when you are in trouble.”
The elephants said “We do not have any intention of hurting mice. So, we will change the route. But, how can you help us? After all you are so small.” The mice thanked them and said that someday they will repay them.
    After some days, the king in the nearby kingdom wanted to increase the number of elephants in his army. Thus he ordered his soldiers to catch elephants.
One day the soldiers trapped many elephants in their net. They thought that they can take the elephants with them after they come back from lunch.
     The king elephant then recollected about the mice. He trumpeted loudly to call the mice. The King mouse immediately came for help. He called all the mice and asked them to nibble all the nets around the elephants. Very soon all the elephants were set free.
    Thereafter the elephants and the mice became great friends.
