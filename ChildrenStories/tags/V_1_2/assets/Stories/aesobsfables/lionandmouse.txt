One day a mouse was making merry and dancing. It suddenly fell on a lion’s tail which was sleeping. This awakened the lion and it became furious. It caught hold of the mouse. The mouse said, “Pardon me, leave me this time, I may be of your help in near future.” The lion laughed as it did not believe that a mouse could be of its help. But, it let it go.

 

After a few days, the lion got trapped by the hunters. The hunters tied the lion to a tree with ropes and went in search of a wagon to carry the lion with them. The mouse was passing by and saw the lion. It came to the lion and chewed and cut the ropes and set the lion free. The lion thanked the mouse and said “you were right when you said that you could help me.”
