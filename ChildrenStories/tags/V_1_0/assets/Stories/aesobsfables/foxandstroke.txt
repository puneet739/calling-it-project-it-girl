Once upon a time a fox and a stork decided to be friends. The fox invited the stork for dinner one day. The stork went to the fox’s place hungry and eager to eat. The fox decided to play a joke. The fox had prepared soup which he poured in a shallow vessel. The fox could easily lap this up whereas the stork could only wet the end of the bill. The fox said, “I am sorry friend but I think you are not able to have anything”.  The stork smiled and said, “ no problem my friend , I am very grateful for this invitation”.

After a few days, the stork invited the fox to its place for dinner. The fox accepted the invitation and arrived at the appointed time. The stork too prepared soup and now put this soup in a long necked jar. The stork could easily finish it, while the mouth of the fox could not reach the soup deep inside the jar. And he remained licking the outside of the jar.
