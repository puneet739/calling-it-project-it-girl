Once Akbar wanted to test his coutiers. He put a question to all of them.Akbar asked “What is the thing that travels fastest in the world?”
One of the courtiers said “Bullock cart”. Another said “ wind”. Yet another said “Light”.
Akbar was waiting for Birbal’s answer. Birbal said “Your majesty! The thoughts in the mind are the fastest to travel.In a moment you are in this court and your next thought can be anywhere else in this world. So, thought is the fastest thing in the world.”
Everyone was very surprised at Birbal’s wisdom. Akbar was proud of Birbal’s wisdom and rewarded him suitably.
